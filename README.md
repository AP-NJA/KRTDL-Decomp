**The Goal:**

My mission is to provide an easy-to-read version of Kirby's Return to Dreamland's ASM code in the much more understandable C++. Note that I will have to learn C++ along the way, so if anything looks unpolished or odd, just remember that I am learning while I work on this project.

**TO-DO:**
- Inspect the game's ASM functions with Ghidra
- Create a symbol map to let others use to import for Ghidra
- Create my data structures, namespaces, and classes to organize information
- Rewrite into C (C++ if required)
- Recompile to a .dol file to load into Dolphin Emulator
